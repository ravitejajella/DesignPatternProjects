Implementing Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems. By implementing them systematically, we can improve code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

Project Structure & Implementation Strategy
1. Creational Patterns (Dealing with object creation mechanisms)
   
Goal: Control object instantiation to avoid tight coupling and improve flexibility.

Pattern	Purpose	Example Use Case
Singleton	Ensures only one instance exists	Database connection, Logger
Factory Method	Defers instantiation to subclasses	UI components (Button, Dialog)
Abstract Factory	Creates families of related objects	Cross-platform UI kits
Builder	Constructs complex objects step-by-step	SQL query builder, HTML generator
Prototype	Clones objects instead of creating new ones	Game entities, cached objects
Implementation Steps:

Define the core structure (e.g., private constructor for Singleton).

Write unit tests to verify single instance, lazy initialization, etc.

Apply in a real-world scenario (e.g., a config manager for Singleton).

2. Structural Patterns (Object composition & relationships)
Goal: Simplify how classes and objects are combined to form larger structures.

Pattern	Purpose	Example Use Case
Adapter	Makes incompatible interfaces work together	Legacy system integration
Bridge	Separates abstraction from implementation	GUI renderers (OpenGL vs. Vulkan)
Composite	Treats individual and group objects uniformly	File system (Files & Folders)
Decorator	Adds responsibilities dynamically	Stream encryption, logging
Facade	Simplifies complex subsystems	API wrappers, payment gateways
Flyweight	Shares objects to reduce memory usage	Game textures, character fonts
Proxy	Controls access to an object	Lazy loading, security checks
Implementation Steps:

Identify where object composition is needed (e.g., Adapter for third-party APIs).

Implement the pattern with interfaces and delegation.

Test with mock objects to ensure correct behavior.

3. Behavioral Patterns (Communication between objects)
Goal: Define how objects interact and distribute responsibilities.

Pattern	Purpose	Example Use Case
Chain of Responsibility	Passes requests along a chain	Middleware in web servers
Command	Encapsulates requests as objects	Undo/Redo operations
Interpreter	Implements a language grammar	SQL parsing, rule engines
Iterator	Traverses collections uniformly	Custom data structures
Mediator	Centralizes complex communications	Chatroom, event brokers
Memento	Captures and restores object state	Save/load functionality
Observer	Notifies dependents of state changes	Event listeners, Pub-Sub
State	Changes behavior based on state	Order status (Pending, Shipped)
Strategy	Swaps algorithms at runtime	Sorting, payment methods
Template Method	Defines a skeleton of an algorithm	Framework hooks
Visitor	Adds operations without modifying classes	Document processing
Implementation Steps:

Define the interaction logic (e.g., Observer with Subject and Observer interfaces).

Implement concrete classes (e.g., EmailNotifier for Observer).

Test with different scenarios (e.g., multiple subscribers).
